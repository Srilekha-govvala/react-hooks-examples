/*⚙️ What’s happening:

You don’t touch the DOM manually.

React automatically re-renders the UI whenever count changes.

The HTML-like syntax (<h1>, <button>) is JSX, compiled by Babel into JavaScript.

✅ Pros:

React handles DOM updates efficiently.

Cleaner and more readable for UI building.

Scales easily with components and state.

❌ Cons:

Slightly heavier (needs setup with Vite, React, Babel).

Overkill for very small apps. */
